A USB-C mod for the 3DS XL!

## This project is not yet fully ready for prime-time. It's still being tested and verified.

This mod was designed for the 3DS XL.

For the original 3DS, I recommend this mod by makho: [makhowastaken/3DS_C](https://github.com/makhowastaken/3DS_C/)

This mod is not compatible with: 2DS, New 2DS XL, New 3DS, New 3DS XL.

This mod requires some case trimming, and I would recommend abandoning your charging dock contacts. More information available in the instructions page.

## Assembly/Instructions

Instructions for assembly/installation can be found in [INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/rorosaurus/3ds-xl-usb-c/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md)
